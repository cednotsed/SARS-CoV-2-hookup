# SARS-CoV-2-hookup
A table for linking up the nucleotide transitions on the SARS-CoV-2 genome with their corresponding amino acid positions and changes. I've also included the associated table comprising the Wuhan-Hu-1 gene coordinates (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/1798174254), and the script used to generate the hookup table.
